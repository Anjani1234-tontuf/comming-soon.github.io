# Contributing a Guide

The guides site uses [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to power the site and all the documents are written using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). To contribute a guide, you just need to follow these simple steps.

1. Fork the [repository on github](https://github.com/railsgirls/railsgirls.github.com) by clicking on the "Fork" button.
2. Do a `git clone` of your fork.
3. Create a file named `YYYY-MM-DD-guide_name.markdown` inside the `_posts` directory of your fork.
4. In this file, you'll need to add some YAML front matter at the top of the file so it looks like the following example, taken from this guide that you are currently viewing:

    <pre>
    ---
    layout: default
    title: Contributing a Guide
    permalink: contributing
    ---</pre>

5. Commit this new guide to your git repo.
6. After you commit, push that to your fork.
7. You can now open a pull request explaining your guide. That's it!

You can follow the structure of our [Rails Girls App Tutorial](https://github.com/railsgirls/railsgirls.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2012-04-18-app.markdown).

Thanks so much for taking the time to help us make Rails Girls awesome.
