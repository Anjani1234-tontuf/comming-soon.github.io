Social Sharing Button Embed Generator
=====================================

Purpose
-------
This tool allows for quick customization of social sharing buttons commonly seen at the bottom of a blog post. This tool aims for visual consistency and minimizing page load delays.

Usage
-----
To see the tool in action, you can find a working example [here](http://jprusik.github.com/social-button-embed-generator/index.html).

Limitations/Known Issues
------------------------
The spacing to the right of the Google+ button is specified after Google's JavaScript is called and is consequently, cumbersome to adjust automatically.

When using "Count on Top" button style, some buttons (Google+/LinkedIn) require an otherwise unnecessary 10px width <span>, in order to achieve visual consistency.
